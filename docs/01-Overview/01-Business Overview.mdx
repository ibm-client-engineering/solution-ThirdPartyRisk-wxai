## Overview
----
The goal of this solution doc is to outline the different methods and its steps to leverage watson<span style={{ color: '#3a60f6' }}>x</span>.ai to facilitate the third party vendor risk assesment process within a financial institution.

### Business Statement

The Third Party Risk team within a financial institution completes over 1000 vendor assessments per year as a part of their ongoing due diligence to vet the institution's third party partners. Each assessment takes about 45 working hours to complete and is driven largely by manual evaluation of documentation, including internal policies, vendor policies, and responses on risk questionnaires.

### Challenges
* **Backlog of assessments** - The institution's Third Party Risk team is behind schedule, with a backlog of assessments impacting the progression of strategic projects and initiatives across the enterprise.
* **Diminished resources on the Third Party Risk team** - Third Party Risk team has to do more with less, as budget constraints have led to team size reductions
* **Increasing workload** - the number of assessments has grown larger every year, with continued increases forecasted
* **Inability to focus on high value work** - including evaluating controls, deepening assessments for critical vendors, improving processes
* **Overly manual process** - 45 working hours per assessment prohibits the Third Party Risk team to safely scale their assessments to meet the enterprise demand

### Use case
First Line of Defense - When vendors send the client their filled out SIG Questionnaires, Assessors take about 6-10 hours to review all of their answers and evidence and summarize which topics are considered “Issues” according to the organization's standards, and which topics require a follow-up discussion with the vendor to clarify their response.
IBM is leveraging wx.ai to augment this process and allow assessors to reduce the time it takes to understand the quality of vendor questionnaire responses.

### Business Outcomes
Estimated 20% reduction in assessment time, amounting to about 10,000 working hours saved by AI or approximately 800k in labor hours per year.

#### **Core Outcomes:**

1. Third party risk Assessors want to programmatically identify all the issues and gaps within a particular vendor SIG relative to the institution's MSR to facilitate the overall assessment process and reduce overall manual tasks.
    * An issue refers to the binary classification on whether or not the expected “appropriate response” has been met by each vendor SIG response
    * A gap refers to the binary classification on whether or not the “Additional Information” provided in the vendor SIG can support the vendor SIG “Response”
2. Third party risk assessors want to programmatically identify all the relevant MSR context which would provide the necessary information to answer the specific SIG question.
    * Need to check if the MSR Context is actually relevant to the SIG question since there will be instance in which a question may not be related to any part of the MSR.
    * Need to provide metadata for each relevant MSR context:
        * Filename
        * Heading
        * Subheading
3. Third party risk assessors want to programmatically provide a “Recommendation” for any Vendor SIG response which requires a follow up and/or has “Additional Information” in the vendor SIG.
    * Provide a recommendation which is anchored on the gap between the relevant “MSR context” for each SIG question and the “Additional Information” provide in the vendor SIG
    * Frame part of the recommendation as questions that could be used as a follow-ups for a vendor
    * Ensure the questions in the recommendation are not already answered in the “Additional Information” provided in the vendor SIG

## Solution Overview
----
Two methods can be leveraged to achieve the desired business outcomes mentioned above.

### **Method 1:** watson<span style={{ color: '#3a60f6' }}>x</span>.ai Pipeline

This method soley relies on the watson<span style={{ color: '#3a60f6' }}>x</span>.ai sdk and python to build a pipeline to achieve the desired outcomes. The pipeline consists of three core phases:
1. Preprocess and embed relevant MSR context.
2. Create golden truth or reference SIG to compare to new Vendor SIGs.
3. Leverage generative AI to create an automated assessor report for each vendor SIG.

### **Method 2:** OpenPages with External Input
This method adapts the same core phases from method 1 to the the IBM OpenPages platform while leveraging an external data source as an input. This ensures consistency in achieving the desired outcomes while leveraging the enhanced capabilities and scalability of OpenPages and watson<span style={{ color: '#3a60f6' }}>x</span>.ai's generative-AI capabilities. The core phases include:
1. Build OpenPages Library.
2. Configure Openpages Vendor Management.
3. Deploy and integrate watson<span style={{ color: '#3a60f6' }}>x</span>.ai models.
